### Idiosyncrasies of Run

- Each windowed run should take about 5-8 seconds each with a few `time.sleep()` statements.
- However, a few runs ran for 130s+, which was unexpected.
	- Windows 6, 7, and 8 had this issue, but due to lack of constant monitoring, addition of other windows to this list is currently impossible.
